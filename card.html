                <p> Eastern Grey Squirrels love to eat a variety of nuts, seeds,
                    berries,
                    flowers and buds.
                    Grey Squirrels have an excellent sense of smell. They
                    communicate with
                    eachother by making
                    sounds and body movements, such as tail flicking. Grey
                    squirrels
                    can swim
                    and hang upside down.
                    They can also be right or left handed!</p>
